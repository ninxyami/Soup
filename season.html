      <h2>About This Season</h2>
      <p>
        Season 1 marks the opening chapter of State of Undead Purge.
        It is designed as a long-term season, not a short-lived experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal is to create a persistent world where stories form naturally,
        progress feels earned, and time matters.

      </p>
