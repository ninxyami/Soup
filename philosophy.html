      <h2>Long-Term Survival</h2>
      <p>
        State of Undead Purge is built as a long-term survival experience.
        Seasons are meant to last. Progress is meant to take time.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not a fast-wipe environment. The goal is not to rush endgame,
        but to live in the world, adapt to it, and build something that lasts.
      </p>

      <h2>PVE-Focused by Design</h2>
      <p>
        The server is Player vs Environment focused.
        The undead, scarcity, and the world itself are the primary threats.
      </p>
      <p>
        Player conflict, griefing, and toxic behavior are not part of the experience.
        Cooperation and mutual respect are expected, not optional.
      </p>

      <h2>Behavior Over Speed</h2>
      <p>
        Progression systems are designed to reward consistency,
        contribution, and presence — not spam, grinding, or exploitation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Playing slower is not a disadvantage here.
        Rushing rarely pays off.

      <h2>Community First</h2>
      <p>
        This server exists to support a friendly, helpful community.
        New players are welcomed. Questions are answered.
        Knowledge is shared.
      </p>
      <p>
        If something threatens the health of the community,
        it does not belong here.

      <h2>Zombita</h2>
      <p>
        Zombita exists as a system, not a personality.
        She observes patterns, not individual messages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Contribution is recognized quietly.
        Disruption is handled without spectacle.
